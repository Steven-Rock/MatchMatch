MatchMatch is a card game that lays out 4x4 grid of cards face down. The object is to turn over 2 cards at a timee showing the images on the card underside. Every image has another matching card. If the 2 cards match, they will remain face up. If they do not match they will turn back face down. You must match all the cards in the shortest number of turns.
